ABOUT HAND CRICKET GAME
----------------------------------------------
Odd or Even Cricket, also known as Hand Cricket, is a simple two-player game that is popular in South India.
One of the players is picked to 'bat' and both players simultaneously choose a number from 1 to 6. When playing against a person, you use your hands to show the number. 
If both players show the same number, the person 'batting' is out. Otherwise, the person batting gets points (runs) equal to the number he picked.
This process repeats until the person batting is out. His final score is the sum of all the points he scored. The person batting and the other player switch roles. 
The same process occurs. Whoever scored more points wins.

There are different strategies that can be employed when playing this game. One strategy would be to pick randomly, but with the probability of each number chosen according to the situation. For example, if you have one run to win, you might pick each number equally; with two runs to win, you might make a 1 less likely
. However, it's important to note that there is no perfect strategy for this game as it depends on the opponent's moves and tactics.
